  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Gregory-Leibniz-Series-MultiThread</h1>
  <p>This is a project I did for fun, to learn about multithreading uses and to put to use my skills with threads (wich are little to no)</p>
  <p>What this program does is: calculate pi with 6 digits (last one is rounded) using the six cores of my processor</p>
  <p>To achive this I'm using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leibniz_formula_for_%CF%80">Gregory-Leibniz's Series</a>, this is a series of sums that when reaching infinite sum up to pi/4</p>

  <p>I really would love to get more than 6 digits, but due to me not being very smart it seems like thats all we're getting</p>
